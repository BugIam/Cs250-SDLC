I interpret user needs into a program by listening to them and ask them questions about what they really want. From their answers I create user stories about the features/components or changes that needs to be implement. User stories allow the team to know their taks and the end goal, who is working on what.
In developing programs, I first have to know what the clients want and from there, I will know what my end product is going to be. I should also consider my team feedback in developing user stories. From now on, I will be using Agile methodology for larger product but when it comes to small and short deadlines projects I will consider waterfall.
To be a good team member means to communicate, ask questions, provide feedbacks and listen to your peers and most importantly do your part of the job by the required deadline.
